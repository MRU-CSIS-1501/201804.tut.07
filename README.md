# Tut-07

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

- Setting your Qualified password (if you haven't already)
- Talking about debugging in Qualified
- Drills, baby - drills!
- And if you wanna work on your assignment, who am I to judge?

## YOUR QUALIFIED PASSWORD

The Qualified invites that I send out seem to allow you to create a Qualified account without a password.

Please confirm you can get into Qualified with a username/password and not through an invite email. If not, please set up your password (JP will help you if you need it).

## DEBUGGING IN QUALIFIED

Unlike REPLIT, there is no terminal window in Qualified. But you can still add trace statements to your code to help debug what's going on.

## YOUR SKILL DRILLS

The following drills are due this Thursday:

- tut-07: lights are on, but...
- tut-07: detecting runs in a sequence
